# Part 1: Creating a simple view

Let's build your first app.

In this tutorial, we’ll create a Grocery Catalog application for an online grocery store called "Oakry".  Oakry’s Catalogue Managers can use the multi-page application to:

* View all products
* Add a new product
* Edit details of a product

We recommend that you use [Appsmith on Cloud](https://docs.appsmith.com/quick-start#appsmith-cloud) for this tutorial. This is the quickest way to get started. Alternatively, you can also [set up Appsmith locally, or on your private instance](https://docs.appsmith.com/quick-start#docker).   
****

Sign up and log in to get started. This tutorial works on all versions of Appsmith, and is agnostic to the operating system you run it on.

The tutorial is organized in three parts and you must follow the sequence in order. ****The first part of the tutorial begins with an introduction to the Appsmith's environment and then walks you through creating a simple web-page that displays products fetched from a database in a table.
