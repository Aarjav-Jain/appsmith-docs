# Introduction

## Why Appsmith?

Today when we need an internal tool, our choices are limited to

* Investing weeks building it from scratch and fighting with HTML/CSS
* Getting started with an admin panel and invest even more time customizing it

Appsmith bridges the gap between [getting started] super quickly and making customizations super easy! 



## How fast is it?

Appsmith makes building internal tools as easy as

* Drag and configure the UI \(No HTML / CSS!\)
* Connect APIs / Databases
* Write snippets of business logic
