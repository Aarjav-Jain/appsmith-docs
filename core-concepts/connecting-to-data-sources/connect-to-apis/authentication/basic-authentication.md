# Basic Authentication

To share basic authentication details across multiple APIs, you can choose to use the `Basic` authentication mechanism within datasources. To do this, click on the `+` icon next to the API section and add the URL. Click on `Save as Datasource` next to the URL, and then under `Authentication` choose basic.

Here, you may enter your username and password. The Appsmith server will generate the corresponding header for all request that use this datasource.
