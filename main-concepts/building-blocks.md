(Some sentences on following lines) Pages are the main building blocks of Appsmith applications - which can be both single-page and multi-page applications. Each page consists of:

- One or more Widgets: What widgets are, add/delete/copy widgets, their place and significance in Appsmith dev platform. Their properties (not the properties pane) but their behavior, and rules governing them. Basically weâ€™ll not get into specific widgets here but help user understand the concept of widgets.

- One or more Data-sources to read from, and/or write to (DB / API): What data-sources are, sharing across pages / orgs, etc. Their properties. Rules governing them. Not getting specific DB or its config but concept.

- JavaScript to transfer data between widgets and resources: Role of JS in appsmith. How it facilitates that. Point to source code as well.
