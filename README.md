# Introduction

## Why Appsmith?

Today when we need an internal app, our choices are limited to:

* Investing weeks or months to build something from scratch
* Getting started with an admin panel framework and struggling to customize it when your needs change

We built Appsmith to help developers build internal apps quickly without dealing with repetitive work.


## How fast is it?

With Appsmith you:

* Drag and configure the UI \(No dealing with HTML or CSS\)
* Connect APIs / Databases
* Write snippets of business logic in JS
