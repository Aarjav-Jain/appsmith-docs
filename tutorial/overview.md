# Overview

Let’s learn by building a small app.  


Through this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the creation of a basic Grocery Catalog application for an online grocery store called Oakry. The application is a multi-page dashboard used by Oakry’s Catalogue Managers to:

* View all products
* Add a new product
* Edit a product’s details

The tutorial is organized in three parts and should be done in the same sequence. ****We recommend that you use [Appsmith on Cloud](https://docs.appsmith.com/quick-start#appsmith-cloud) for this tutorial. This is the quickest way to get started. Alternatively, you can also [set up Appsmith locally, or on your private instance](https://docs.appsmith.com/quick-start#docker). We’ll assume that you have a working Appsmith deployment before you start the tutorial, i.e. you should be able to sign up and log into your Appsmith installation.

Let's get started!
