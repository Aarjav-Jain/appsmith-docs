# Initial setup

If this is your first time using Appsmith, youâ€™ll need to get acquainted with some initial setup. When you log in, you'll be redirected to your Appsmith home-page. The home-page has an auto-generated organization called **Your Personal Organization** that consists of multiple templates. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use the same organization.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure that you use the auto-generate organization for the tutorial. It has a mock database set up that you will need to follow the tutorial.
