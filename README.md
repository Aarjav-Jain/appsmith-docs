# Introduction

## Why Appsmith?

Today when we need an internal tool, our choices are limited to

* Investing weeks building it from scratch and fighting with HTML/CSS
* Getting started with an admin panel and invest even more time customizing it

Appsmith bridges the gap between [getting started](getting-started/) super quickly and making customizations super easy! The best part?

### _No HTML / CSS!_

## How fast is it?

Appsmith makes building internal tools as easy as

* Drag and configure the UI \(No HTML / CSS!\)
* Connect APIs / Databases
* Write snippets of business logic

Check out our demo video to see how easy it is!
