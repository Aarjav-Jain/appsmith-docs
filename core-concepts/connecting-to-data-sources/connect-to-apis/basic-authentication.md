# Basic Authentication

If your backend has a standard set of headers or parameters that need to be sent with every request, you can save these as a common data source. Simply click the save as data source option at the end of the URL and add the common parameters.

This mechanism can be used to _Base64 encode_ your credentials right when you save the header parameters using Javascript functions in combination with a static or dynamic binding reference to your username and password.
