# Part 1: Creating a basic view

Let’s learn by building a small app.  


Through this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the creation of a basic Grocery Catalog application for an online grocery store called Oakry. The application is a multi-page dashboard used by Oakry’s Catalogue Managers to:

* View all products
* Add a new product
* Edit a product’s details

We recommend that you use [Appsmith on Cloud](https://docs.appsmith.com/quick-start#appsmith-cloud) for this tutorial. This is the quickest way to get started. Alternatively, you can also [set up Appsmith locally, or on your private instance](https://docs.appsmith.com/quick-start#docker). We’ll assume that you have a working Appsmith deployment before you start the tutorial.

If Appsmith is installed, you should be able to sign up and log in. This tutorial works well on all versions of Appsmith, and is agnostic to the operating system you run it on.

The first part of the tutorial begins with an introduction to the Appsmith's environment and then walks you through creating a simple web-page that displays products fetched from a database in a table.
