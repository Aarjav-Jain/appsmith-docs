# Tutorial

Let's build your first app.

Through this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the creation of a basic Grocery Catalog application for an online grocery store called Oakry. The application is a multi-page dashboard used by Oakry’s Catalogue Managers to:

* View all products
* Add a new product
* Edit details of a product

The tutorial is organized into three parts. You must follow it in the sequence in order. \_\*\*\_We recommend that you use [Appsmith on Cloud](https://docs.appsmith.com/quick-start#appsmith-cloud) for this tutorial. This is the quickest way to get started. Alternatively, you can also [set up Appsmith locally, or on your private instance](https://docs.appsmith.com/quick-start#docker). We’ll assume that you have a working Appsmith deployment before you start the tutorial.
