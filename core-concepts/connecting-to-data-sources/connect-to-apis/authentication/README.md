## Authentication

In case the APIs that you wish to connect to are protected by an authentication mechanism, you can set up the requisite configuration at the data source level. Appsmith currently supports the following authentication mechanisms:

- [Basic](basic-authentication.md)
- [OAuth 2.0](oauth2-authentication.md)
