# Part 3: &lt;to be decided&gt;

This tutorial begins where [Tutorial 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MF52io4nymFJoeAoKQnOlovHMtwh5qbk0kRb9rNU1fI/edit#heading=h.40i6tula7jnz) left off. You've built a multi-page tool that allows you to view all products, and add a new product. This tutorial walks you through building the functionality to edit a product.  During this, you'll learn to:

1. Work with widgets' default value property
2. Set up an API to update a product \[to add this when mock update API is ready\]
3. Bind multiple actions on a single event
